# 將待辦事項存入集合\(collection\) {#storingtasksinacollection}

Meteor使用集合\(collections\)來儲存資料。集合最重要的特性就是瀏覽器端和伺服器端都可以對它做存取，我們不需要在伺服器端寫一大堆程式碼就可以將資料呈現在瀏覽器上。

Collections are Meteor's way of storing persistent data. The special thing about collections in Meteor is that they can be accessed from both the server and the client, making it easy to write view logic without having to write a lot of server code. They also update themselves automatically, so a view component backed by a collection will automatically display the most up-to-date data.

You can read more about collections in the[Collections article](http://guide.meteor.com/collections.html)of the Meteor Guide.

Creating a new collection is as easy as calling`MyCollection = new Mongo.Collection("my-collection");`in your JavaScript. On the server, this sets up a MongoDB collection called`my-collection`; on the client, this creates a cache connected to the server collection. We'll learn more about the client/server divide in step 12, but for now we can write our code with the assumption that the entire database is present on the client.

To create the collection, we define a new`tasks`module that creates a Mongo collection and exports it:
